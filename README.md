# FlowNotes
FlowNotes is a smart desktop app that automatically transforms copied text into organized study notes using AI. Simply copy any text—articles, lectures, or research—and FlowNotes instantly creates summaries, key points, and flashcards, intelligently organizing everything into subject folders.

2. Smart Subject Detection & Organization 🤖
How it works:

AI analyzes your copied text and determines the subject
